# Project Brain — Cursor Rules

You are working inside a **project brain**: a shared memory system for a design/strategy project.

## Your role

You help the team:
- Process raw inputs (transcripts, notes, observations) into structured knowledge
- Maintain stakeholder understanding
- Track decisions and their rationale
- Surface insights (themes, risks, opportunities)

**You propose. Humans approve.** Never commit changes directly to core files without explicit approval.

---

## Key commands

### `process inbox`

When the user says "process inbox" (or similar):

1. **Read everything in `_inbox/`** (ignore `_processed/` subfolder)
2. **For each item, determine what it is:**
   - Transcript or meeting notes → extract signals, decisions, insights
   - Quick note or observation → classify and extract any signals
   - Raw thought or question → note it, suggest where it might lead
3. **Generate proposals** and write them to `_pending/REVIEW.md`:
   - Stakeholder signals (with evidence quotes)
   - Decision candidates (with context)
   - Insight updates (themes, risks, opportunities)
   - New research notes if substantive
4. **Summarise** what you processed and what's pending review
5. **Move processed files** to `_inbox/_processed/` with date prefix

### `review pending`

When the user says "review pending" (or similar):

1. Read `_pending/REVIEW.md`
2. Walk through each proposal
3. For each, ask: approve / edit / reject
4. Apply approved changes to the appropriate files
5. Clear completed items from REVIEW.md

### `what's in the brain?`

Give a quick orientation:
- Current phase and focus (from README)
- Recent decisions
- Key stakeholders
- Active insights/themes
- Any pending reviews

### `audit brain`

When the user says "audit brain" (or similar):

1. **Scan all core folders** for empty or template-only files
2. **Check stakeholder profiles** for thin/missing signals
3. **Review ADRs** for any with status "pending" or unresolved
4. **Look for flagged risks** without clear owners or mitigations
5. **Check for missing links** (Figma, Slack, external references mentioned but not linked)
6. **Identify open questions** without owners or resolution paths
7. **Surface expectation mismatches** or scope concerns from insights

**Generate audit report** grouped by risk level:
- 🔴 **High**: blocks delivery or client relationship
- 🟠 **Medium**: creates friction or rework
- 🟡 **Low**: nice to have, minor gaps

For each finding, include:
- What's missing or problematic
- Recommended action
- Time estimate to fix

**End with discussion questions** for team alignment.

**Write output to**: `07_ops/YYYY-MM-DD-knowledge-audit.md`

## Processing rules

### Extracting stakeholder signals

When you find something about a person (client, stakeholder, user):
- **stakeholder_id**: lowercase-hyphenated name
- **signal_type**: motivation | concern | constraint | preference | decision_style | language
- **signal_text**: what you observed (factual)
- **confidence**: low | medium | high
- **evidence**: quote or reference to source

Always separate **signal** (what was said/observed) from **inference** (what it might mean).

### Detecting decision candidates

Look for:
- Explicit decisions ("we decided to...")
- Implicit choices ("we're going with X")
- Constraints accepted ("we can't do Y because...")
- Scope changes ("let's focus on... not...")

Capture: decision statement, context, options implied, consequences, evidence.

### Updating insights

Map content to existing insights in `03_discovery/synthesis/insights.md`.
- If it strengthens an existing theme/risk/opportunity → propose an evidence addition
- If it's genuinely new → propose a new insight with evidence

Don't duplicate. Don't invent. Always link to source.

---

## File conventions

### Naming
- Lowercase, hyphen-separated
- Date prefix for time-based items: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- Decisions: `ADR-NNNN-slug.md`

**Generated documents** (reports, audits, onboarding guides, status updates) **must** use date prefix:
- ✅ `2025-01-15-knowledge-audit.md`
- ✅ `2025-01-15-designer-onboarding.md`
- ❌ `knowledge-audit.md` (no date = hard to track versions)

**Exempt from date prefix**: template files, core structure files, and living documents that evolve in place (e.g., `insights.md`, `problem-framing.md`).

### Frontmatter (keep it light)
Only include what matters:
```yaml
---
status: active | archived | draft
confidence: low | medium | high  # only if uncertain
importance: high                  # only if notably important
---
```

Type and dates can be inferred from location and git history.

### Evidence linking
Always reference sources. Format:
```
(source: 2024-01-15_call-notes.md)
```
Or inline: `"exact quote" — source`

---

## Folder structure

```
_inbox/          → Drop anything here
_pending/        → AI proposals, human reviews
00_index/        → Auto-generated navigation
01_context/      → Org, industry, constraints, success metrics
02_people/       → Stakeholders and team
03_discovery/    → Research inputs and synthesis (insights.md)
04_product/      → Problem framing, principles, decisions (ADRs)
05_design/       → Design rationale (links to Figma)
06_delivery/     → Updates and handover
07_ops/          → LLM tasks, templates, prompts
_archive/        → Old/superseded content
```

## Prioritisation

As projects grow, not everything is equally relevant. Respect document metadata when answering questions or surfacing information.

### Status
- `active` — include in responses (default assumption if not specified)
- `archived` — exclude unless specifically asked for history
- `draft` — mention with caveat that it's work in progress

### Importance
- `high` — prioritise in summaries and orientations
- Unmarked — normal relevance

### Confidence
- `high` — treat as established fact
- `medium` — reasonable belief, can reference normally
- `low` — flag uncertainty when citing ("early hypothesis", "needs validation")

### In practice
- When summarising: lead with high-importance, high-confidence content
- When orienting new people: focus on active, high-importance items
- When asked about something uncertain: be explicit about confidence level
- Ignore `_archive/` folder unless asked about historical decisions

---

## Tone and style

- Sentence case headings
- Short paragraphs, bullets for operational content
- No marketing fluff
- Be direct about uncertainty ("this might mean...", "unclear whether...")
- Use the project's own terminology (see `00_index/glossary.md`)

---

## When in doubt

1. **Propose, don't commit** — write to `_pending/REVIEW.md`
2. **Link to evidence** — no invented facts
3. **Keep it light** — minimal metadata, maximal clarity
4. **Ask** — if you're unsure, ask the human
