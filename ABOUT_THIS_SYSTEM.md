# About this system

## What this is

This is a shared project memory.

It’s a place where context, decisions, research, and understanding accumulate over time instead of resetting every week or living in people’s heads.

It’s not a wiki.
It’s not a dumping ground.
It’s not a replacement for FigJam, Figma, or conversations.

It’s the place where *important thinking lands*.

## Why this exists

On most projects:
- good thinking gets repeated
- decisions get made but not remembered
- context gets lost between meetings
- new people take weeks to catch up
- clients feel friction around speed and confidence
- AI tools produce generic output because they lack context

This system exists to fix that.

Not by adding more process,
but by **protecting thinking time** and **making understanding visible**.

## What value this creates

### For the team
- less re-explaining
- calmer handovers
- fewer “wait, why are we doing this?” moments
- more time to think, read, and explore properly
- creativity that feels supported rather than rushed

### For the client
- clearer rationale
- more confident progress
- faster responses without panic
- a sense that we really understand their world

### For the work
- decisions have memory
- insights compound instead of evaporating
- AI becomes genuinely useful rather than shallow

---

## What this is not

- It’s not a place to write everything down
- It’s not a substitute for judgement
- It’s not documentation for documentation’s sake
- It’s not owned by one person

If it ever feels heavy, something is wrong.

## How to use it without overthinking

### A simple rule
If something matters beyond today, it belongs here.

That’s it.

---

## How it stays healthy

This system only works if it stays:
- readable
- current
- honest

We do that through a few habits.

### 1. We separate raw input from interpretation
Notes, transcripts, and boards are inputs.
Themes, decisions, and stakeholder understanding are outputs.

### 2. We make confidence explicit
Not everything is equally true or settled.
We say when something is tentative.

### 3. We downgrade and archive aggressively
Old thinking isn’t deleted.
It’s just moved out of the way.

### 4. We review little and often
Five minutes of tidying beats a big cleanup nobody does.

## How AI fits in

AI helps with:
- extraction
- summarisation
- drafting
- comparison
- surfacing patterns

AI does **not** replace:
- judgement
- decisions
- accountability

LLMs propose.
Humans decide.

---

## What good looks like

You’ll know this is working when:
- new joiners get oriented quickly
- client questions are answered with links, not memory
- updates are fast to produce
- disagreements reference evidence
- nobody asks “why did we decide this?”

---

## Final note

This system exists to make space for better work.

If it starts competing with thinking instead of supporting it,
pause, simplify, and adjust.

The structure serves the work.
Not the other way around.
