# Research workflow

When asked to research a client, company, industry, or build project context:

## Quick triggers

- "Research [company]" → Full company research package
- "Build context for [project]" → Project-focused research  
- "Industry analysis for [sector]" → Industry deep-dive
- "Who are the stakeholders?" → Stakeholder mapping

## Research sequence

For comprehensive client research:

1. **Company basics** → What they do, how they make money, scale, leadership
2. **Industry context** → Market structure, major players, key terminology
3. **Competitive position** → Direct/indirect competitors, basis of competition
4. **Constraints** → Regulations, compliance, operational constraints
5. **Synthesis** → Pull it together into actionable project context

## Output files

All research outputs go to `_pending/` for review:

- `company-profile.md` — What the company does, business model, leadership
- `industry-landscape.md` — Market structure, players, terminology
- `competitive-position.md` — Where they sit vs competitors
- `constraints-and-regulations.md` — What limits or governs the business
- `market-dynamics.md` — Forces shaping the market
- `stakeholder-landscape.md` — Decision-makers and influencers
- `business-context.md` — Project-specific synthesis

## File frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: research
status: pending
confidence: [high|medium|low]
sources: [number]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
researcher: Claude
---
```

## Quality markers

- `[VERIFY]` — Single source or inference required
- `[ASK CLIENT]` — Need client input to confirm

## Confidence levels

- **High**: Multiple authoritative sources agree
- **Medium**: Single authoritative source or reasonable inference
- **Low**: Limited sources or significant inference required

## After research

1. Review generated files in `_pending/`
2. Edit/approve via `_pending/REVIEW.md`
3. Move approved content to `01_context/`
4. Update `00_index/` if needed
