# Ways of working

## The one rule
**If it matters, drop it in `_inbox/`.**

Everything else flows from there.

## How the brain works
1. Drop raw input in `_inbox/` (notes, transcripts, thoughts, anything)
2. Type `process inbox` in Cursor
3. Review proposals in `_pending/REVIEW.md`
4. Approve, edit, or reject

No filing. No weekly maintenance. Just drop and approve.

## Tools
- **Memory**: This repo (markdown)
- **Work surfaces**: FigJam, Figma, slides, spreadsheets
- **AI workflow**: Cursor with `.cursorrules`

## Cadence
- **After key meetings**: Drop notes in inbox
- **When you remember**: Process inbox
- **When you have 5 minutes**: Review pending items
- **Weekly**: Glance at README, update current focus
