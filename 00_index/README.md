## How this repo works

**You drop things in `_inbox/`. AI does the rest.**

The folders exist so knowledge has a home — but you don't need to think about them. When you run `process inbox`, Cursor reads your raw inputs and files them appropriately.

### Folder structure
- `_inbox/` — drop anything here
- `_pending/` — AI proposals waiting for review
- `01_context/` — org background, industry, constraints
- `02_people/` — stakeholders and team
- `03_discovery/` — research and synthesis (insights live here)
- `04_product/` — problem framing, principles, decisions
- `05_design/` — design rationale, links to Figma
- `06_delivery/` — updates and handover
- `07_ops/` — LLM tasks and prompts
- `_archive/` — old/superseded content
